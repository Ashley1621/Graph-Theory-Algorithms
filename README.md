# Graph-Theory-Algorithms
# This software demonstrates the Auslander-Parter algorithm. Users can draw their own graphs or select from demo graphs.

The algorithms' implementation can be found in `src/Algorithms/AuslanderParter.java`.
See chapter 4 of my dissertation for the theory behind the algorithm: https://github.com/Nodeocrat/client/blob/redux/Auslander-Parter.pdf
